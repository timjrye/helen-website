				<h1>What is Therapy?</h1>

				<p>Therapy offers you a safe, confidential place to talk about your life and anything that may be
					confusing, painful or uncomfortable. It allows you to talk with someone who is trained to listen
					attentively and to help you improve things.</p>

				<h3>How will therapy make me feel?</h3>
				<p>Therapy is a very personal process. Sometimes it is necessary to talk about painful feelings or
					difficult decisions, so you may go through a period of feeling worse than when you started. However,
					therapy should enable you to feel better in the long-run.</p>

				<p>If you do experience a period of feeling worse, talk to your therapist about it to ensure you get the
					best out of your therapy.</p>

				<h3>Will I feel better straight away?</h3>
				<p>Usually it will take a number of sessions before therapy starts to make a difference. However on rare
					occasions, a single session may be enough.</p>

				<h3>Does it work for everybody?</h3>
				<p>Therapy doesn’t work for everybody. It is not a universal cure-all. Because you may be talking about
					very personal and often painful things, it can sometimes be difficult to keep going. Despite this,
					it is often worth the effort as you can be helped to work through problems.</p>

				<h3>Is all therapy the same?</h3>
				<p>No. There are different methods and approaches to therapy, and your chosen therapist will be able to
					talk to you about their particular method or approach.</p>
