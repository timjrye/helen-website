				<h2>My training</h2>

				<p>I have trained with an organisation based in West London, called WPF (Westminster Pastoral
					Foundation) on a UKCP (the UK professional body for Counsellors and Psychotherapists) accredited
					course. This is a rigorous and long training. We are required to have therapy ourselves and to
					complete at least 450 hours of client work before qualification. The qualification I have is the
					Postgraduate Diploma in Psychodynamic Counselling.</p>

				<p>I have been working for many years with adult and adolescent clients with a wide variety of issues. I
					have chosen not to specialise but to work broadly with the various life difficulties we all face.
				</p>

				<h2>How I work</h2>

				<p>Psychodynamic counselling has a long and respected track record. It is based on the premise that we
					all have a tendency to repeat patterns of behaviour which we have learned during growing up through
					our family relationships and formative experiences. Even though we may like to change, we feel
					unable to and are stuck in familiar ways of dealing with situations. In this model of counselling
					the relationship between counsellor and client is central to the work, and painful situations in the
					present that have roots in the past can be understood in a clearer way. This understanding offers
					the possibility of greater freedom of thought and actions.</p>
